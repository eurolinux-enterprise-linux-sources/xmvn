* Random ideas (no milestone assigned)

** plugin API


* Deferred features

** improved configuration

*** final fields
    some configuration settings cannot be overridden by offspring
    configuration files

*** configuration from pluginManagement
    just like Eclipse M2E does

*** singleton configurator
    configurator should generate configuration once and cache it

*** in tests don't modify configuration directly
    clone it and customize the clone

** improve compat package resolver
   maybe version ranges, maybe number of matching components
