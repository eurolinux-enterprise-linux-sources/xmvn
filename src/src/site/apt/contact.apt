Preferred ways of contact


Bugzilla

  All security-insensitive bugs should be reported on
  {{{http://bugzilla.redhat.com/}Red Hat Bugzilla}}.  The appropriate
  product for XMvn is <<<Fedora>>>, component is <<<xmvn>>>.
  Anonymous users have read-only access and can only browse bugs.  In
  order to submit new bug report or comment on existing one you need
  to have an account on Red Hat Bugzilla and log in with your
  credentials.

  Submitting patches is described in detail in a separate document.

Mailing list

  Topics related to usage and development of XMvn can be discussed on
  {{{mailto:java-devel@fedoraproject.org}Fedora Java mailing list}}.
  To get a reply you need to
  {{{http://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/java-devel}subscribe}}
  to the list.  Alternatively you can check
  {{{http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/java-devel/}list
  archives}}.

  When positing to the mailing list please follow some basic rules.
  Don't top-post, send messages in plain text (not HTML), don't CC the
  sender when replying to a message, try to limit line lengths to 72
  characters, avoid non-ASCII characters.

IRC

  Internet Relay Chat is the preferred way of asking quick questions
  and other real-time communication.  You can find XMvn developers and
  maintainers hanging out on <<<#fedora-java>>> on Freenode.

  If you don't get any response in reasonable then you can try
  contacting <<<mizdebsk>>> directly.

Private mail

  As the last resort way of contacting XMvn authors you can send them
  private email.  You can find their addresses in
  {{{https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/xmvn.git/plain/AUTHORS}AUTHORS
  file}}, which is available in source distribution.

  Please do <<not>> send private emails asking for support.  The
  mailing list is for such purposes.
