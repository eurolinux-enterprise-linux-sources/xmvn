XMvn is a community project, new contributotrs are welcome. The most
straightforward way to introduce new features is writting them yourself.
The preferred way to requests features and report bugs is Red Hat Bugzilla:
  http://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=fedora&component=xmvn

The easiest way to get support is asking on IRC -- #fedora-java on freenode.
